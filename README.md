# MyMaths Thingy
This project is written in python and uses [requests_html](https://pypi.org/project/requests-html/) for navigation and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for scraping because they are amazing.
## To Do
To send mark for tasks the following form data is needed:
* `taskID`
* `q1score - q4score`
* `studentID`
* `sCode`
* `authToken`  
The last two are random so thats cool. `taskID` and `studentID` can be found in a `embed` object's `src` data. For the scores, the max mark can be found in the page so thats ok.
