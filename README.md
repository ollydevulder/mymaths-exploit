# MyMaths Thingy
1) Get session ID cookie
2) Login as school
3) Get new session ID
4) Login as student
5) Do whatever <-
## Todo
* Should probably use html parser since its a standard lib
* Actually do the exploit lol
## Currently
To send mark for tasks the following form data is needed:
* `taskID`
* `q1score - q4score`
* `studentID`
* `sCode`
* `authToken`  
The last two are random so thats cool. `taskID` and `studentID` can be found in a `embed` object's `src` data. For the scores, the max mark can be found in the page so thats ok.
